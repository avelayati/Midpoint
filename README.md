# Midpoint Metthod Solver
Midpoint method solver for numerical approximation of ODEs

- ODE2 is the solver mfile (function) and ODE is the script that contains two ODE examples solved via Midpoint solver
- Isert both mfiles in the same search directory in MATLAB and use the script (ODE.m) to solve your ODE
